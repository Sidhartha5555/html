         Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios 
        and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[a] it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by
        Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt 
        Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, 
        Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Shaun Toub. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist
        group, world-famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes
        the superhero Iron Man.  A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 
        20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the 
        rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount 
        Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when
        trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March
        to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories
        that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their
        own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of
        the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the
        title character.

        Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man. Produced
        by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[a] it is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and 
        the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin
        Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, 
        Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after
        Iron Man, Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man 
        technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Rourke)
        uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family. Following the
        critical and commercial success of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately 
        set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was
        signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from 
        Iron Man, while Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes.
        In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting 
        cast. Filming took place from April to July 2009, mostly in California as in the first film, 
        except for a key sequence in Monaco. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical
        effects, the sequel primarily relied on computer-generated imagery to create the Iron Man suits.

        Iron Man 3 (titled onscreen as Iron Man Three)[4][5] is a 2013 American superhero film based on the Marvel
        Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion 
        Pictures.[a] It is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2010), and the seventh film in the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Shane Black from a screenplay he co-wrote with Drew 
        Pearce, and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy 
        Pearce, Rebecca Hall, St√©phanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, William Sadler, Miguel Ferrer, Jon Favreau, 
        and Ben Kingsley. In the film, Tony Stark grapples with the consequences of the events of The 
        Avengers (2012) during a national terrorism campaign on the United States led by the mysterious Mandarin.
        After the release of Iron Man 2 in May 2010, director Favreau chose not to return for a third film. 
        Black was hired to write and direct the sequel in February 2011, working with Pearce to make the script
        more character-centric, focus on thriller elements, and use concepts from Warren Ellis's "Extremis" 
        comic book story arc. The film's supporting cast, including Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall, were brought
        on throughout April and May 2012. Filming took place from May 23 to December 17, 2012, primarily at 
        EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional filming took place around North 
        Carolina as well as in Florida, Los Angeles, and China; an extended version of the film specifically
        for Chinese audiences was created. Seventeen companies provided the film's visual effects.
